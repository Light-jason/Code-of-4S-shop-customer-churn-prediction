# Code-of-4S-shop-customer-churn-prediction
Here are some models for predicting the churn situation of 4S car shops.

Data is divided into two parts:
(1)warranty record
(2)customer attributes
Because the dataset is commericial and privacy, we just show the code of our model.

We used some classical machine learning model and neural network,such as LR、MLP、RNN、LSTM。
And we propose a specific deeping learning architecture,named RNN-2L(LSTM-2L), to distinct the warranty features and customer
attributes for promoting the run-speed and accuracy.
